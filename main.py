## Instructions
## Complete each of these problems by writing a function
## Keep your functions readable
## Use ES6+ syntax
## Try to use array methods like forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce() instead of loops
## This exercise is less about getting the answers. It is about building good problem-solving skills and habits.
## Practice the skills of experimenting#testing with what you already know
## Writing sample tests to check your work
##     Identifying edge cases and planning for them, such as:
##         What happens if you don’t get the data type you expect
##         Does it handle positive numbers, negative numbers, decimals
##         Does it handle empty arrays, strings, undefined
## Looking up and reading the documentation for concepts you’re not sure of
## Creating a problem-solving process (write it down, iterate on it, improve upon it)
## Creating a process for when you’re stuck (write it down, iterate on it, improve upon it)
## Creating a process for troubleshooting (write it down, iterate on it, improve upon it)
## Identifying what you know from the problem as you read
##     What are the inputs?
##     What is the function expected to return?
##     What types of data are mentioned?
## Cluing into what hints are given for writing the code as you read
## Breaking down a problem into parts
## Writing testable code quickly
## Writing pseudocode when you get stuck
## Using pseudocode to help you break down problems
## Imagining good data structures to use
## How to write functions that protect against errors or handle errors better
## Refactoring code after writing tests that your code passes
##     Identifying when a function does more than 1 thing and could be broken into two simpler functions
## Re-using code, if one of these problems allows you to write a function that can help with another problem somehow, figure out if you can re-use that code or modify it, so it can satisfy both problem statements
